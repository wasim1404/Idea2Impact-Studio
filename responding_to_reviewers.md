## Sample Response Formats

### Format 1: Reviewer-by-Reviewer

```
Response to Reviewer #1

Comment 1: "The methodology lacks sufficient detail regarding sample size calculation."
Response: We thank the reviewer for this important observation. We have added a detailed power analysis on page 7, which demonstrates that our proposed sample size of 120 participants will provide 85% power to detect effect sizes of d=0.3 or larger. We have also included a justification for why this effect size is appropriate based on previous studies in this area (see references 23-25).

Comment 2: "The budget for equipment seems excessive."
Response: We appreciate the reviewer's concern about the equipment budget. We have reduced this by 15% (from $75,000 to $63,750) by eliminating redundant backup systems and extending the usage of existing laboratory equipment. The revised budget and justification can be found on pages 22-23.
```

### Format 2: Thematic Organization

```
Methodological Concerns

Reviewer #1, Comment 1: "The methodology lacks sufficient detail regarding sample size calculation."
Reviewer #3, Comment 2: "How will you account for potential attrition in your longitudinal design?"
Response: We have substantially revised the Methodology section to address these concerns. Specifically:
1. We have added a detailed power analysis (page 7) demonstrating that our sample size of 120 provides adequate statistical power.
2. We have incorporated an attrition management plan (page 8) that includes: (a) oversampling by 20% to account for expected attrition, (b) implementation of retention strategies that achieved 85% retention in our previous studies, and (c) analytical approaches to handle missing data.
```

### Format 3: Table Format

```
| Reviewer | Comment | Response | Location of Changes |
|----------|---------|----------|--------------------|
| #1, C3 | "The theoretical framework needs stronger connection to recent literature." | We have strengthened the theoretical framework by incorporating five recent studies (2020-2023) that demonstrate the evolving understanding of this phenomenon. We have explicitly connected our hypotheses to this updated theoretical model. | Pages 3-4, paragraph 2; Figure 1 revised |
| #2, C1 | "Broader impacts appear limited to academic audiences." | We have expanded our broader impacts to include a partnership with the Regional School District to implement findings in K-12 settings. We have added letters of support and a specific dissemination plan for educational practitioners. | Pages 15-16; Appendix C (letters) |

## Examples of Effective Responses

### Example 1: Addressing Methodological Concerns

**Reviewer Comment:**  
"The proposed sample size seems inadequate given the heterogeneity of the population and the number of variables being examined."

**Effective Response:**  
"We appreciate the reviewer's concern about our sample size. In response, we have:

1. Conducted a more detailed power analysis using G*Power software, which indicates that our revised sample size of 180 (increased from 120) will provide 90% power to detect medium effect sizes (fÂ² = 0.15) in our most complex analysis involving 5 predictors (see page 8, Figure 2).

2. Added stratified sampling procedures to ensure adequate representation across key demographic variables, reducing within-group heterogeneity (pages 9-10).

3. Included a multiple imputation approach to handle missing data, which will help maintain statistical power (page 12).

4. Reduced the number of secondary outcomes from 5 to 3, focusing on those most central to our research questions (page 6).

These changes collectively address the concern about statistical power while maintaining feasibility within our budget constraints."

### Example 2: Addressing Significance Concerns

**Reviewer Comment:**  
"While technically sound, the proposal does not make a compelling case for why this research is significant beyond incremental advances in the field."

**Effective Response:**  
"We thank the reviewer for highlighting the need to better articulate the significance of our work. We have substantially revised the Significance section (pages 3-5) to address this concern:

1. We have added new data from a recent meta-analysis (Johnson et al., 2022) demonstrating that this problem affects 28% of the population and costs approximately $3.2 billion annually in healthcare and productivity losses.

2. We have more explicitly connected our research to three national priorities identified in the Surgeon General's 2023 report, specifically highlighting how our approach addresses a critical gap in intervention strategies (page 4).

3. We have included testimonials from two major stakeholder organizations (Appendix B) describing how our research could inform their practice guidelines, potentially affecting care for over 50,000 patients annually.

4. We have clarified how our approach represents a paradigm shift rather than an incremental advance by contrasting the dominant single-factor models with our proposed integrative framework (Figure 1, page 5).

These revisions demonstrate both the practical significance of addressing this problem and the conceptual significance of our novel approach."

### Example 3: Addressing Feasibility Concerns

**Reviewer Comment:**  
"The proposed timeline seems overly ambitious given the complexity of the intervention and the challenges of recruiting the target population."

**Effective Response:**  
"We agree with the reviewer that our original timeline did not adequately account for potential challenges. We have made the following adjustments:

1. Extended the project timeline from 3 to 4 years, allowing more time for recruitment and intervention implementation (revised timeline on page 18, Figure 4).

2. Added a 3-month pilot phase to test recruitment strategies and refine protocols before full implementation (page 19).

3. Established partnerships with three community organizations that serve our target population, as evidenced by the new letters of support (Appendix C). These partners have committed to assisting with recruitment and providing space for intervention activities.

4. Included more detail about our successful recruitment of similar populations in previous studies, including specific strategies that achieved 85% of our target within the projected timeframe (page 20).

5. Developed a contingency plan with decision points and alternative approaches if recruitment falls behind schedule (page 21, Table 3).

These changes create a more realistic timeline while ensuring we can still accomplish our core objectives within the grant period."
