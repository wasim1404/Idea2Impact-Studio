# Grant Writing Best Practices

## Understanding the Funding Agency

### Research the Agency's Mission and Priorities
- Study the agency's strategic plan, mission statement, and recent funding patterns
- Review previously funded projects in your field
- Understand the agency's review process and evaluation criteria

### Analyze the Funding Call Carefully
- Identify explicit and implicit priorities
- Note specific requirements, restrictions, and eligibility criteria
- Pay attention to budget constraints and allowable costs
- Mark all deadlines and submission requirements
- Include a direct link to the funding call when available

### Connect with Program Officers
- Reach out with specific, well-prepared questions
- Request feedback on concept papers or pre-proposals when possible
- Understand how your project fits within their portfolio

## Crafting a Compelling Proposal

### Develop a Clear, Focused Research Question
- Ensure your research question is specific and addressable
- Frame the question in terms relevant to the funding agency
- Demonstrate why this question matters now

### Structure for Readability and Impact
- Use clear headings and subheadings that follow the solicitation structure
- Include visual elements (figures, tables, diagrams) to clarify complex concepts
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout
- Ensure logical flow between sections

### Write a Powerful Executive Summary/Abstract
- Capture the essence of your proposal in one page
- Clearly state the problem, approach, and expected outcomes
- Highlight both intellectual merit and broader impacts
- Make it accessible to non-specialists on the review panel

### Craft a Compelling Introduction
- Hook the reader with the significance of the problem
- Establish your credibility and preparation
- Provide a clear roadmap of the proposal
- End with a concise statement of your objectives

## Strengthening Your Case

### Demonstrate Feasibility
- Include preliminary data when possible
- Cite your relevant previous work
- Provide detailed methodological approaches
- Address potential challenges and alternative approaches

### Highlight Innovation
- Clearly articulate what's novel about your approach
- Distinguish your work from existing research
- Explain how your project advances the field
- Connect innovation to the agency's priorities

### Develop a Realistic Timeline and Milestones
- Create a detailed project schedule with specific deliverables
- Include decision points and evaluation metrics
- Demonstrate thoughtful project management
- Ensure timeline aligns with requested budget and resources

### Create a Strategic Budget
- Align budget items directly with project activities
- Provide detailed justification for each expense
- Ensure costs are reasonable and allowable
- Consider cost-sharing opportunities if appropriate

## Addressing Broader Impacts

### Integrate Education and Outreach
- Develop meaningful educational components
- Create opportunities for student training and mentorship
- Design outreach activities that extend beyond academia
- Consider impacts on curriculum development

### Promote Diversity and Inclusion
- Develop specific strategies for broadening participation
- Consider impacts on underrepresented groups
- Address accessibility and inclusion in research activities
- Partner with minority-serving institutions when appropriate

### Plan for Dissemination and Knowledge Transfer
- Detail publication and presentation strategies
- Consider open access and data sharing approaches
- Identify potential stakeholders beyond academic audiences
- Develop plans for technology transfer if applicable

## Polishing Your Proposal

### Use Clear, Precise Language
- Avoid jargon and acronyms when possible
- Define technical terms when necessary
- Use active voice and direct statements
- Be conciseâ€”every word should serve a purpose

### Incorporate Strategic Repetition
- Reinforce key messages throughout the proposal
- Use consistent terminology for important concepts
- Ensure alignment between sections (objectives should connect to methods, which should connect to evaluation)

### Seek Peer Review
- Have colleagues both within and outside your field review the proposal
- Request feedback on clarity, feasibility, and significance
- Address all feedback before submission

### Proofread Meticulously
- Eliminate grammatical and spelling errors
- Check formatting against agency guidelines
- Verify all references and citations
- Ensure all required components are included

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Overambitious Scope
- Proposing more than can reasonably be accomplished
- Failing to prioritize research activities
- Inadequate resources for proposed activities

### Weak Alignment with Agency Priorities
- Generic proposals not tailored to the specific call
- Failing to use the agency's language and frameworks
- Not addressing explicit evaluation criteria

### Insufficient Methodological Detail
- Vague descriptions of research approaches
- Inadequate explanation of data analysis
- Missing discussion of potential challenges

### Poor Integration of Components
- Disconnected sections that don't build on each other
- Broader impacts that feel "tacked on"
- Budget items not clearly linked to project activities

### Unclear Writing
- Dense, jargon-filled prose
- Excessive use of passive voice
- Long, complex sentences that obscure meaning
- Poor visual presentation and organization

## After Submission

### If Funded
- Review award terms and conditions carefully
- Establish project management systems
- Set up regular check-ins with program officers
- Document progress toward objectives

### If Not Funded
- Request reviewer comments
- Analyze feedback objectively
- Consider consultation with program officers
- Revise and resubmit if appropriate

Remember that grant writing is both an art and a science. These best practices provide a foundation, but successful proposals also reflect the passion, expertise, and unique perspective of the researcher. The most compelling proposals not only meet all technical requirements but also tell a compelling story about important work that needs to be done.
