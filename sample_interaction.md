# Sample Interaction with AI Research Proposal Mentor

## Initial Conversation

**User:** I'm interested in applying for the NSF Sustainable Energy Research Initiative. I'm an Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering specializing in catalysis for clean energy applications. Can you help me develop a competitive proposal?

**Assistant:** I'd be happy to help you develop a competitive proposal for the NSF Sustainable Energy Research Initiative (SERI). Let me first extract the key details from this funding opportunity:

**Title:** Sustainable Energy Research Initiative (SERI)
**Scheme Type:** Competitive Research Grant
**Duration:** 2-3 years
**Budget Range:** $300,000 - $750,000 per year
**Thrust Areas:**
1. Novel materials for energy conversion and storage
2. Grid modernization and smart energy systems
3. Sustainable bioenergy and biofuels
4. Energy-efficient manufacturing processes
5. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies
6. Renewable energy integration and optimization

Based on your expertise in catalysis for clean energy applications, your research aligns well with thrust areas #1 (Novel materials for energy conversion and storage) and potentially #5 (Carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies).

To help me better understand your specific expertise and how it aligns with this funding opportunity, could you share more about:
1. Your specific research focus within catalysis
2. Any preliminary data or previous work relevant to the thrust areas
3. Your key research achievements that demonstrate your capability in this field

**User:** My research focuses on developing novel heterogeneous catalysts for renewable hydrogen production through water electrolysis. I've recently published in Nature Energy on high-performance bifunctional catalysts derived from earth-abundant materials. I've also done work on electrochemical CO2 reduction using nanostructured carbon-supported transition metal catalysts. I currently have a DOE grant on electrocatalysts for hydrogen production that ends next year, and I'm looking to extend this work in new directions.

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing those details. Your expertise in heterogeneous catalysts for renewable hydrogen production and electrochemical CO2 reduction positions you very well for this NSF SERI funding opportunity. Let me highlight the alignment:

1. Your work on bifunctional catalysts from earth-abundant materials (published in Nature Energy) directly addresses thrust area #1 (Novel materials for energy conversion and storage)
2. Your research on electrochemical CO2 reduction connects to thrust area #5 (Carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies)
3. Your current DOE grant provides a foundation to build upon, showing both expertise and the potential for new directions

Based on NSF's evaluation criteria (Intellectual Merit 40%, Broader Impacts 30%, Implementation Plan 30%), we should develop a proposal that:

1. Extends your catalyst work in innovative directions
2. Demonstrates clear societal benefits and educational components
3. Presents a feasible, well-structured implementation plan

Let's start developing your proposal section by section. First, could you share your thoughts on a potential problem statement that builds on your expertise but offers something novel beyond your current DOE-funded work?

## Problem Statement Development

**User:** I'm thinking about addressing the challenge of scaling up hydrogen production using my catalyst technology. Current electrolyzers face degradation issues when scaled up, and the materials cost remains prohibitive for widespread adoption. I want to focus on developing next-generation catalysts that maintain high activity but with dramatically improved durability and at lower cost.

**Assistant:** That's an excellent problem statement that builds on your expertise while addressing critical challenges in the field. Let me help refine it into a compelling narrative for your proposal:

**Problem Statement Draft:**

"Despite significant advances in electrocatalyst development for hydrogen production, the widespread adoption of water electrolysis for clean hydrogen generation faces two critical barriers: (1) catalyst degradation during long-term operation, particularly at industrial scales, and (2) the high cost of materials required for efficient catalytic performance. While our previous work has demonstrated high-performance bifunctional catalysts derived from earth-abundant materials, significant challenges remain in translating these laboratory-scale achievements into durable, cost-effective systems capable of meeting the demands of industrial hydrogen production. This proposal addresses these challenges by developing next-generation heterogeneous catalysts with dramatically improved durability and reduced materials cost, while maintaining or enhancing catalytic activity."

This problem statement effectively:
- Builds on your established expertise (referencing your previous work)
- Identifies specific, important challenges (degradation and cost)
- Positions your proposed work as the next logical step in addressing these challenges
- Aligns with NSF SERI thrust area #1 (Novel materials for energy conversion and storage)

Does this capture your vision? Would you like to modify or expand any aspects of this problem statement?

**User:** That looks great. I'd also like to emphasize the potential impact on renewable energy integration (thrust area #6) since improved hydrogen production could serve as energy storage for intermittent renewables.

**Assistant:** Excellent point! Let me revise the problem statement to incorporate the connection to renewable energy integration (thrust area #6):

**Revised Problem Statement Draft:**

"Despite significant advances in electrocatalyst development for hydrogen production, the widespread adoption of water electrolysis for clean hydrogen generation faces two critical barriers: (1) catalyst degradation during long-term operation, particularly at industrial scales, and (2) the high cost of materials required for efficient catalytic performance. While our previous work has demonstrated high-performance bifunctional catalysts derived from earth-abundant materials, significant challenges remain in translating these laboratory-scale achievements into durable, cost-effective systems capable of meeting the demands of industrial hydrogen production. This challenge is particularly pressing given hydrogen's potential as an energy storage medium for intermittent renewable energy sourcesâ€”a key strategy for enabling greater grid integration of solar and wind power. This proposal addresses these challenges by developing next-generation heterogeneous catalysts with dramatically improved durability and reduced materials cost, while maintaining or enhancing catalytic activity, thereby advancing both materials innovation (thrust area #1) and renewable energy integration (thrust area #6)."

This revised statement now:
- Maintains the original strengths
- Explicitly connects your work to energy storage for intermittent renewables
- Directly references two SERI thrust areas (#1 and #6)
- Strengthens the broader impact narrative by highlighting the role in renewable energy integration

Shall we move on to developing your research objectives based on this problem statement?

## Research Objectives Development

**User:** Yes, let's develop the research objectives. I'm thinking of three main objectives: (1) synthesize and characterize novel earth-abundant catalysts with enhanced stability, (2) investigate degradation mechanisms under realistic operating conditions, and (3) develop strategies to mitigate degradation while maintaining high activity.

**Assistant:** Those are excellent research objectives that flow logically from your problem statement. Let me help formulate them in a clear, measurable format that will appeal to NSF reviewers:

**Research Objectives Draft:**

**Objective 1: Design and Synthesize Next-Generation Earth-Abundant Catalysts with Enhanced Stability**
- Develop at least three novel catalyst compositions based on non-precious metals with targeted modifications to enhance stability
- Characterize structural, electronic, and surface properties using advanced techniques (XPS, EXAFS, HR-TEM, etc.)
- Evaluate initial catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in standard testing conditions

**Objective 2: Elucidate Degradation Mechanisms Under Realistic Operating Conditions**
- Develop an accelerated stress testing protocol that simulates industrial operating conditions (variable current densities, start-stop cycles, impurities)
- Perform in-situ and operando characterization to identify structural and chemical changes during operation
- Establish quantitative relationships between specific material properties and degradation rates

**Objective 3: Develop and Validate Strategies to Mitigate Degradation While Maintaining High Activity**
- Implement targeted structural modifications based on degradation mechanism insights
- Explore protective coatings and composite structures to enhance stability

**Objective 4: Assess Scalability and Economic Viability for Renewable Energy Integration**
- Develop scaled-up synthesis protocols for the most promising catalyst formulations
- Evaluate performance in prototype electrolyzer systems under variable load conditions mimicking renewable energy input
- Perform techno-economic analysis to quantify cost reduction potential and identify pathways to commercial viability

I've added a fourth objective that explicitly addresses the scalability and renewable energy integration aspects, which strengthens the connection to thrust area #6 and enhances the broader impacts of your proposal.

Each objective is specific, measurable, and builds logically on the previous one. Together, they form a comprehensive research plan that addresses both the fundamental science (degradation mechanisms) and practical applications (scalable, economically viable catalysts for renewable energy integration).

Do these objectives capture your research vision? Would you like to modify any aspects or add specific technical approaches you plan to use?

## Methodology Development
